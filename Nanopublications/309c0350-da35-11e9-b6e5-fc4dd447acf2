Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Several lines of evidence indicate that FGF2 plays an important role in the invasive properties of human cancer cells , . Thus, we examined the effect of FGF2 on cell invasion in ovarian cancer cells using Matrigel-coated Transwell invasion assays. OVCAR-4 and SKOV-3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of FGF2, resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of invasion ( ). The involvement of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in FGF2-stimulated cell invasion were also evaluated. Our results showed that FGF2-induced cell invasion was markedly diminished, but not totally, by treatment with wortmannin, rapamycin or U0126 alone ( ), while combined inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways totally abolished FGF2-induced cell invasion ( ). Taken together, these results indicate that the MAPK/ERK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathways are involved in FGF2-induced ovarian cancer cell invasion. (A) Ovarian cancer cells were seeded in Matrigel-coated transwell inserts and treated with different doses of FGF2 for 24 h. (B) Cells were pre-treated with wortmannin (1 µM), rapamycin (20 nM) or U0126 (10 µM) for 30 min and seeded in Matrigel-coated transwell inserts and cultured with 10 ng/ml FGF2 for 24 h. Results represent the mean ± SEM [(A) n = 3; (B) n = 6; values without a common letter are significantly different, P<0.05]. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Next, we asked whether down-regulation of E-cadherin mediated the FGF2-induced cell invasion. SKOV-3 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type human E-cadherin expression plasmid for 48 h and then were treated with FGF2 for further 24 h ( ). FGF2 treatment reduced E-cadherin protein levels in cells transfected with empty vector, whereas no effect was detected in cells overexpressing E-cadherin ( )." .
